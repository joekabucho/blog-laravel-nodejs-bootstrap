# Xblog


[English README ](https://github.com/lufficc/Xblog)|[Documents](https://lufficc.com/blog/how-to-install-my-blog)

This is a blog that I personally use, and I used to use Hexo and github pages to get through the site, which is not flexible. So I wrote this blog with Laravel.
What I want to say is that Laravel is the best php framework.

Follow-up will share some of the experience of writing this blog, welcome to pay attention.

If you find bugs, welcome to issue.
